# Services, Load Balancing, and Networking
Kubernetes networking addresses four concerns:

- Containers within a Pod use networking to communicate via loopback.
- Cluster networking provides communication between different Pods.
- The Service resource lets you expose an application running in Pods to be reachable from outside your cluster.
- You can also use Services to publish services only for consumption inside your cluster.
