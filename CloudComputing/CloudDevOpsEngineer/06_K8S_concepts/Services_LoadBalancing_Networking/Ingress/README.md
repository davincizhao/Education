# Terminology 
For clarity, this guide defines the following terms:

- Node: A worker machine in Kubernetes, part of a cluster.
- Cluster: A set of Nodes that run containerized applications managed by Kubernetes. For this example, and in most common Kubernetes deployments, nodes in the cluster are not part of the public internet.
- Edge router: A router that enforces the firewall policy for your cluster. This could be a gateway managed by a cloud provider or a physical piece of hardware.
- Cluster network: A set of links, logical or physical, that facilitate communication within a cluster according to the Kubernetes networking model.
- Service: A Kubernetes Service that identifies a set of Pods using label selectors. Unless mentioned otherwise, Services are assumed to have virtual IPs only routable within the cluster network.
