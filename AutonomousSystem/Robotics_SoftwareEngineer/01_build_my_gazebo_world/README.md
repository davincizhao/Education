create a simulation world for all projects

**repos structure**
```

```
## Steps to build
- Build a single floor wall structure using the **Building Editor** tool in Gazebo. Apply at least one feature, one color, and optionally one texture to  structure. Make sure there's enough space between the walls for a robot to navigate.
- Model any object of  choice using the Model Editor tool in Gazebo. The model links should be connected with joints.
- Import structure and two instances of  model inside an empty Gazebo World.
- Import at least one model from the Gazebo online library and implement it in  existing Gazebo world.
- Write a C++ World Plugin to interact with  world. 
- Display “Welcome to ’s World!” message as soon as launch the Gazebo world file.
