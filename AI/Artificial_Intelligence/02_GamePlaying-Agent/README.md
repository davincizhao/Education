### The Minimax Algorithm
The Artificial Intelligence a Modern Approach (AIMA) textbook provides the following pseudocode for the minimax algorithm. As Thad presents the concept in lectures, you'll also work through coding exercises to implement this algorithm. Then you'll complete a project to build an agent using this algorithm to play a more complex version of the game.
