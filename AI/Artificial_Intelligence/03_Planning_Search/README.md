# heuristic analysis
## 1. Base on the result table below.:
Problem 1 ‘s optimal plan is #7 greedy best first graph search 
Problem 2 ‘s optimal plan is #7 greedy best first graph search 
Problem 3 ‘s optimal plan is #3 depth first graph search
## 2. Compare and contrast non-heuristic search result metrics: **3** depth first graph search is the best search 
methods.
## 3. Compare and contrast heuristic search result metrics: **7** greedy best first graph search .
## 4. The best heuristic is **7** greedy best first graph search. In problem1 and problem 2, the #7 greedy best 
first graph search better than all non-heuristic search. But in problem3 is not better than non-heuristic 
search “**3** depth first graph search”. Because **7** greedy best first graph search almost create 8 times 
nodes of **3** depth first graph search, spend 7 times of time to finished the searching.
