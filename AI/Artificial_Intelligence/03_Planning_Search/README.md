# heuristic analysis
## 1. Base on the result table below.:
- Problem 1  optimal plan is Number 7 greedy best first graph search 
- Problem 2  optimal plan is Number7 greedy best first graph search 
- Problem 3  optimal plan is Number3 depth first graph search
## 2. Compare and contrast non-heuristic search result metrics: **Number 3** depth first graph search is the best search 
methods.
## 3. Compare and contrast heuristic search result metrics: **Number 7** greedy best first graph search .
## 4. The best heuristic is **Number 7** greedy best first graph search. In problem1 and problem 2, the Number 7 greedy best 
first graph search better than all non-heuristic search. But in problem 3 is not better than non-heuristic 
search “**Number 3** depth first graph search”. Because **Number 7** greedy best first graph search almost create 8 times 
nodes of **Number 3** depth first graph search, spend 7 times of time to finished the searching.
